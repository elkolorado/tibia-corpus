# Tibia Corpus

Welcome to the `tibiacorpus.py` project! This is a Python script that allows to create corpus for Tibia. The data used is [npc_conversations](https://resources.talesoftibia.com/data/npcs/transcripts.json), [npc_dialogues](https://resources.talesoftibia.com/data/npcs/npc-data.json), and [books](https://resources.talesoftibia.com/data/books/books.json), which originates from [talesoftibia.com](https://github.com/s2ward/talesoftibia.com). Eventually aim of this project is to have an set of all words in tibia, which might be useful in various mysteries.
